# Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Network

## Introduction
### 1. Briefly explain the topic of the text
   - The paper is mainly related to show the visualization opertation of convolution Network and show the details of how CNN extract detailed feature from each layer by visualization method. Besides, it perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from each layer of the network.
### 2. Present the aim of the text and summarize the main finding or key argument.
- I. Introduce a visualization technique the reveals the input stimuli that excite feature maps at each layer of the network model
- II. Observe the development and evolution of features during training to diagnose the potential problems in model
- III.Propose use a muti-layered Deconvolution Nework to project the feature activation back to the input pixel space
- IV. Perform a sensitivity analysis of classifier, review which part of sense are important for classification
### 3. Conclude the introduction with a brief statement of your evaluation of the text.-
- Visualization with Deconvnet use top-down projections that reveal structures within each patch that stimulate a particular feature map demonstrate a clear understanding of how the network cature feature details, and the readers of the paper will have an incisive conception of the framework of CNN from a scientific standpoint.


## Summmary
### 1. Present a summary of the key points along with a limited number of examples.
